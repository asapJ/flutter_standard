## Usage

### Initializing a Flutterwave instance

To create an instance, you should call the Flutterwave constructor. This constructor accepts a mandatory instance of the following:

- The calling `Context`
-  `publicKey`
-  `Customer`
-  `amount`
-  `currency`
-  `email`
-  `fullName`
-  `txRef`
-  `isDebug`
-  `paymentOptions`
-  `Customization` 

It returns an instance of Flutterwave which we then call the async method `.charge()` on.

    _handlePaymentInitialization() async { 
    final style = FlutterwaveStyle(
     appBarText: "My Standard Blue", 
     buttonColor: Color(0xffd0ebff), 
     appBarIcon: Icon(Icons.message, color: Color(0xffd0ebff)),
     buttonTextStyle: TextStyle( 
	     color: Colors.black, 
	     fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, 
	     fontSize: 18), 
    appBarColor: Color(0xffd0ebff), 
    dialogCancelTextStyle: TextStyle(
	    color: Colors.redAccent, 
	    fontSize: 18
	    ),
    dialogContinueTextStyle: TextStyle(
		    color: Colors.blue, 
		    fontSize: 18
		    ) 
		  ); 

    final Customer customer = Customer(
		    name: "FLW Developer", 
		    phoneNumber: "1234566677777", 
		    email: "customer@customer.com"
		    );  
		    
    final Flutterwave flutterwave = Flutterwave(
		    context: context, 
		    style: style, 
		    publicKey: "Public Key, 
		    currency: "RWF", 
		    redirectUrl: "my_redirect_url" 
		    txRef: "unique_transaction_reference", 
		    amount: "3000", 
		    customer: customer, 
		    paymentOptions: "ussd, card, barter, payattitude", 
		    customization: Customization(title: "Test Payment"),
		    isDebug: true
		    ); 
		} 

### Handling the response

Calling the `.charge()` method returns a Future of `ChargeResponse` which we await for the actual response as seen above.



     final ChargeResponse response = await flutterwave.charge(); 
     if (response != null) { 
	     print(response.toJson()); 
		 if(response.success) { 
		 Call the verify transaction endpoint with the transactionID returned in `response.transactionId` to verify transaction before offering value to customer 
		 } else { 
		  // Transaction not successful 
		} 
	 } else {
	  // User cancelled 
	 }

#### Note

 1. `ChargeResponse` can be null if a user cancels the transaction by pressing back.
 2. You need to confirm the transaction is succesful. Ensure that the txRef, amount, and status are correct and successful. Be sure to [verify the transaction details](https://developer.flutterwave.com/docs/verifications/transaction) before providing value.
